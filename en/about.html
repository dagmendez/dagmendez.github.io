              <p><strong>Hey!</strong> Have you ever wondered how I got here? Like many <em>millennials</em>, I was the family's "official tech guy" – from setting up computers
                 to fixing any IT crisis. While my youth was defined by hours of gaming on Windows, I also dove into hardware (building PCs from scratch) and Linux experimentation.
              </p>

              <p>But here's the twist: I studied Economics and then did an MBA in International Trade. It was during my second year as an analyst that I faced a challenge: 
                processing <em>monster</em> Excel spreadsheets on an office computer that, let's say, wasn't up to the task.
              </p>

              <p>Thanks to my years of <em>tinkering</em> with the terminal, I wasn't afraid of the black screen. So I dove into data analytics: first with R and Python, 
                then moved to data engineering with Spark and Scala. One thing led to another, and suddenly I found myself working in the systems where data is actually 
                generated. From data analyst to <em>backend</em> engineer in distributed systems.
              </p>

              <p>And as if that weren't enough, the cloud became the <em>king</em> of enterprise environments. So my tech stack evolved: from HDFS, Spark and MongoDB to S3,
                 Databricks, DynamoDB and Kinesis (or their equivalents in Azure/GCP). <strong>Because technology never stops,</strong> and neither do I.
